The training and evaluation of a SDM requires many steps, governing both its design and reporting [@Zurell2020] and ultimate use and interpretation [@Araujo2019]. In the recent years, there has been an increase in the number of software packages and tools to assist ecologists with the development of species distribution models.\n\nBecause the practice of species distribution modeling and analysis usually involve many different data types, tools that can provide an integrated environment are important: many existing packages have been designed independently, and therefore may suffer when it comes to interoperability. In this manuscript, we present **SpeciesDistributionToolkit** (abbreviated as **SDT**), a meta-package for the **Julia** programming language, offering an integrated environment for the retrieval, formatting, and interpretation of data relevant to the modeling of species distributions.\n\nAs @Kass2024-vy point out, this increase in the diversity of packages (most of them in the **R** language) is a good thing, as it can accommodate multiple workflows, and contributes to the adoption of good practices in the field. Yet, @Kellner2025 highlight that about 20% of publications for abundance or distribution models are not reproducible because of issues in package dependencies. A leading design consideration for **SDT** was to prevent this issue from happening, both by relying on strict semantic versioning, but also through the use of interfaces rather dependencies between the components of **SDT**.\n\nThe **SDT** package is now used as part of the BON-in-a-Box project [@Griffith2024], which seeks to facilitate the calculation and reporting of biodiversity indicators supporting the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework, to remove barriers to biodiversity data analysis [@Gonzalez2023]. In this manuscript, we describe (i) the high-level functionalities of the package, (ii) core design principles that facilitate long-term maintenance and development, and (iii) illustrative case studies with fully reproducible Jupyter notebooks.\n\n# Application description\n\n**SpeciesDistributionToolkit** is released as a package for the **Julia** programming language [@Bezanson2017], licensed under the open-source initiative approved MIT license. It has evolved from a previous collection of packages to handle GBIF data [@Dansereau2021], and now provides extended functionalities and improved performances. The package is registered in the **Julia** package repository and can be downloaded and installed anonymously. It is compatible with version 1.8 and above. The full source and complete edition history is available at [`https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl`]. This page additionally has a link to the documentation, containing a full reference for the package functions, a series of briefs how-to examples, and longer vignettes showcasing more integrative examples.\n\n  [`https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl`]: https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpeciesDistributionToolkit.jl\n\n## Component packages\n\nAn overview of the **SDT** package is given in @fig-components. The project is organized as a \"monorepo\", in which multiple packages live. This allows expanding the scope of the package by moving functionalities into new component packages, without complexifying the installation process. As **SDT** is registered in the **Julia** package repository, it can be installed by using `add SpeciesDistributionToolkit` when in package mode at the **Julia** prompt.\n\nWhen loading the **SDT** package with `using SpeciesDistributionToolkit`, all component packages are automatically and transparently loaded. Therefore, users do not need to know where a specific method or function resides to use it. In the next section, we discuss how this modular design ensure that we can grow the functionality of the toolkit over time, while maintaining strict backward compatibility *and* allowing full reproducibility of an analysis.\n\n![Overview of the packages included in **SpeciesDistributionToolkit**. The packages are color-coded by intended use, and their more specific content is presented in the main text. Note that because the package relies on *interfaces* to facilitate code interoperability, there are only three dependency relationships.]\n\n  [Overview of the packages included in **SpeciesDistributionToolkit**. The packages are color-coded by intended use, and their more specific content is presented in the main text. Note that because the package relies on *interfaces* to facilitate code interoperability, there are only three dependency relationships.]: figures/SDT.png {#fig-components}\n\nThe **SDT** package primarily provides integration between the other packages, through the mechanism of method overloading, allowing to efficiently join packages together [@Roesch2023]. Additional functionalities that reside in the top-level package are the generation of pseudo-absences inspired by @Barbet-Massin2012, access to the `gadm.org` database, handling of polygon data and zonal statistics, and various quality of life methods. Because of the modular nature of the code, any of these functions can be transparently moved to their own packages in the future.\n\nThe **SimpleSDMLayers** package offers a series of types to represent raster data in various projections, and a series of functions to operate on these layers. This package provides the main data representation for most functionalities that **SDT** supports, and handles saving and loading data.\n\nThe **OccurrencesInterface** is a light-weight package to provide a common interface for occurrence data. It implements abstract and concrete types to define a single occurrence and a collection thereof, and a series of methods allowing any occurrence data provider or data representation to become fully interoperable with the rest of **SDT**. All **SDT** methods that handle occurrence data do so through the **OccurrencesInterface** interface, allowing future data sources to be integrated without the need for new code.\n\nThe **GBIF** package offers access to the `gbif.org` streaming API [@GBIF:TheGlobalBiodiversityInformationFacility2025], including the ability to retrieve, filter, and restart downloads. Although this package returns a rich data representation for occurrence data, all the objects it returns adhere to the **OccurrencesInterface** interface.\n\n**SimpleSDMDatasets** implements an interface to retrieve and locally store raster data, which can be extended by users to support additional data sources. In addition, it offers access to a series of data sources, including the biodiversity mapping project [@Jenkins2013], the EarthEnv collection for land cover [@Tuanmu2014] and habitat heterogeneity [@Tuanmu2015], Copernicus land cover 100m data [@Buchhorn2020], the PaleoClim [@Brown2018] data, the WorldClim 1 and 2 data [@Fick2017] and their projections under various RCPs and SSP, and part of the CHELSA 1 and 2 data [@Karger2017] and their projections under various RCPs and SSPs.\n\n**Phylopic** offers a wrapper around the `phylopic.org` API to download silhouettes for taxonomic entities. It also provides utilities for citation of the downloaded images. Its functionalities are similar to the **rphylopic** package [@Gearty2023].\n\nThe **Fauxcurrences** packages is inspired by the work of @Osborne2022, and allows generating a series of simulated occurrence data that have the same statistical structure as observed ones. The package supports multi-species data, with user-specified relative weight of intra and inter-specific distances conservation.\n\nThe **SDeMo** package is aimed at providing tools to use as part of training and education material on species distribution modeling. By providing a series of data transformation (PCA, Whitening, z-score) and classifiers (BIOCLIM, Naive Bayes, and decision trees), it offers the basic elements to demonstrate training and evaluation of SDMs, as well as techniques related to ensembles and bagging. In addition, to promote the use of interpretable techniques, the package supports regular [@Elith2005] and inflated [@Zurell2012] partial responses, as well as the calculation and mapping of Shapley values [@Wadoux2023; @Mesgaran2014], and the generation of counterfactuals [@VanLooveren2019, @Karimi2019].\n\n## Software information\n\n**SDT** uses the built-in **Julia** package manager to ensure that the version of all dependencies are kept up to date. Furthermore, we use strict semantic versioning: major versions correspond to no breaking changes in user-developped code, minor versions increase with additional functionalities, and patch releases cover minor bug fixes or documentation changes. All packages have a *CHANGELOG* file, which documents what changes are included in each release. Following a constructive cost model analysis [@Kemerer1987] of the version described in this publication, the package represents approx. 11k lines of active code (no blank lines, no comments), for an estimated development cost of approx. 325k USD.\n\nThis strict reliance on semantic versioning solves the issues of maintaining compatibility when new functionalities are added: all releases in the *v1.x.x* branch of **SDT** depend on component packages in their respective *v1.x.x* branch, and users can benefit from now functionalities without risking to break existing code. This behavior is extensively tested, both using unit tests, and through integration testing generated as part of the online documentation.\n\n## Integration with other packages\n\nThe **SDT** package benefits from close integration with other packages in the **Julia** universe. Notably, this includes **Makie** (and all related backends) for plotting and interactive data visualisation, where usual plot types are overloaded for both layer and occurrence data. Most data handled by **SDT** can be exported using the **Tables** interface, which allows data to be consumed by other packages like **DataFrames** and **MLJ**, or directly saved as csv files.\n\nInterfaces internal to **Julia** are also implemented whenever they make sense. In particular, **SimpleSDMLayers** objects behave like arrays, are iterable, and broadcastable; objects from **OccurrencesInterface** behave as arrays and are similarly iterable. The **SDeMo** package relies on part of the **StatsAPI** interface, allowing to easily define new data transformation and classifier types to support additional features.\n\nAchieving integration with other packages through method overloading and the adherence to well-established interfaces is important, as it increases the chances that additional functionalities external to **SDT** can be used directly or fully supported with minimal addition of code.\n\n# Illustrative case studies\n\nIn this section, we provide a series of case studies, meant to illustrate the use of the package. The on-line documentation offers longer tutorials, as well as a series of how-to vignettes to illustrate the full scope of what the package allows. The code for each of these case studies is available as fully independent Jupyter notebooks, forming the supplementary material of this article. The example we use throughout is the distribution of *Akodon montensis* (Rodentia, family Cricetidae), a host or orthohantaviruses [@Burgos2021; @Owen2010], in Paraguay. As the notebooks accompanying this article cover the full code required to run these case studies, we do not present code snippets in the main text, and instead focus on explaining which component packages are used in each example.\n\n## Using data from GBIF\n\nTo illustrate the interactions between the component packages, we provide a simple illustration (Supp. Mat. 1) where we (i) request occurrence data using the **GBIF** package, (ii) download the silhouette of the species through **Phylopic**, and (iii) extract temperature and precipitation data at the points of occurrence. The results are presented in @fig-gbif-phylopic. The full notebook includes information about basic operations on raster data, as well as extraction of data based on occurrence records.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed appendix/gbif.ipynb#fig-gbif-phylopic >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, although the data are retrieved using the **GBIF** package, they are used internally by **SDT** through the **OccurrencesInterface** package. This package defines a small convention to handle georeferenced occurrence data, and allows to transparently integrate additional occurrence sources. By defining five methods for a custom data type, users can plug-in any occurrence data source and enjoy full compatibility with the entire **SDT** functionalities.\n\n## Landcover consensus map\n\nIn this case study (Supp. Mat. 2), we retrieve the land cover data from @Tuanmu2014, clip them to a GeoJSON polygon describing the country of Paraguay (**SDT** can download data directly from `gadm.org`), and apply the `mosaic` operation to figure out which class is the most locally abundant. This case study uses the **SimpleSDMDatasets** package to download (and locally cache) the raster data, as well as the **SimpleSDMLayers** package to provide basic utility functions on raster data. The results are presented in @fig-landcover-consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed appendix/consensus.ipynb#fig-landcover-consensus >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen first downloading data through **SimpleSDMDatasets**, they will be stored locally for future use. When the data are requested a second time, they are read directly from the disk, speeding up the process massively. Note that the location of the data is (i) standardized by the package itself, making the file findable to humans, and (ii) changeable by the user to, *e.g.*, store the data within the project folder rather than in a central location. As much as possible, **SDT** will only read the part of the raster data that is required given the region of interest to the user. This is done by providing additional context in the form of a bounding box (in WGS84, regardless of the underlying raster data projection). **SDT** has methods to calculate the bounding box for all the objects it supports.\n\n## Training a species distribution model\n\nIn this case study, we illustrate the integration of **SDeMo** and **SimpleSDMLayers** to train a species distribution model. We specifically train a rotation forest [@Bagnall2018], an homogeneous ensemble of PCA followed by decision trees. The results are presented in @fig-sdm-output. The model is built by selecting an optimal suite of BioClim variables, then predicted in space, and the resulting predicted species range is finally clipped by the elevational range observed in the occurrence data.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed appendix/sdm.ipynb#fig-sdm-output >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full notebook (Supp. Mat. 3) has additional information on routines for variable selection, stratified cross-validation, as well as the construction of the ensemble from a single PCA and decision tree. In addition, Supp. Mat. 3 presents the partial responses and Shapley values for the most important predictor.\n\n## Distribution of a virtual species\n\nIn the final case study (Supp. Mat. 4), we simulate a virtual distribution [@Hirzel2001], using a species with a logistic response to each environmental covariate [@Leroy2016], and a prevalence similar to the one predicted in @fig-sdm-output. The results are presented in @fig-virtual-species.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed appendix/virtualspecies.ipynb#fig-virtual-species >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the layers used by **SDT** are broadcastable, we can rapidly apply a function (here, the logistic response to the environmental covariate) to each layer, and then multiply the suitabilities together. The last step is facilitated by the fact that most basic arithmetic operations are defined for layers, allowing for example to add, multiply, substract, and divide them by one another.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe have presented **SpeciesDistributionToolkit**, a package for the **Julia** programming language aiming to facilitate the collection, curation, analysis, and visualisation of data commonly used in species distribution modeling. Through the use of interfaces and a modular design, we have made this package robust to changes, easy to add functionalities to, and well integrated to the rest of the **Julia** ecosystem. All code for the case studies can be found in Supp. Mat. 1-4.\n\nPlans for active development of the package are focused on (i) additional techniques for pseudo-absence generations, likely leading to their separate component package, (ii) full compatibility with the **MultivariateStatistics** and **Clustering** packages for transformation and aggregation, and (iii) additional **SDeMo** functionalities to allow cross-validation techniques with biological relevant structure [@Roberts2017].\n\n**Acknowledgements:** TP is funded by an NSERC Discovery grant, a Discovery Acceleration Supplement grant, and a Wellcome Trust grant (223764/Z/21/Z).\n\n",
