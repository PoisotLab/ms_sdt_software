## Introduction

## Application description

### Component packages

### Software information

### Integration with other packages

- Makie
- DataFrames (Tables)
- Arrays interface
- interfaces built in the package

## Worked out example

In this section, we provide a worked out example of (i) collecting data on historical and future climate, (ii) projecting these data into a new CRS, (iii) collecting occurrence data within a country boundaries, (iv) training a random-forest classifier for the species, and (v) transfering this model to future climate data. This provides an illutration of most of the components of the package.

### Collecting climate data

```{julia}
provider = RasterData{CHELSA2, BioClim}
```
