## Introduction

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are one of the most effective predictive approach to study the global distribution of biodiversity [@Elith2009]. The training and evaluation of a SDM requires many steps, governing both its design and reporting [@Zurell2020] and ultimate use and interpretation [@Araujo2019].

@Kass2024-vy large number of packages

many steps - integration is important

### Integration with other packages

The **SDT** package benefits from close integration with other packages in the Julia universe. Notably, this includes **Makie** (and all related backends) for plotting and data visualisation, where usual plot types are overloaded for layer and occurrence data. Most data can be exported using the **Tables** interface, which allows data to be consumed by other packages like **DataFrames** and **MLJ**. Interfaces internal to Julia are also implemented whenever they make sense. Layers behave like arrays, are iterable, and broadcastable; occurrences collections are arrays and iterables. Beyong supporting external interfaces, **SDT** defines its own internally. Access to raster data is supported by a trait-based interface for **SimpleSDMDatasets**, and one of the component packages (**OccurrencesInterface** implements a minimalist interface to facilite the consumption of occurrence data.

Internal use of other interfaces like StatsAPI

## Illustrative case studies

In this section, we provide a series of case studies, meant to illustrate the use of the package. The on-line documentation offers longer tutorials, as well as a series of how-to vignettes to illustrate the full scope of what the package allows. The code for each of these case studies is available as fully independent Jupyter notebooks, forming the supplementary material of this article.
